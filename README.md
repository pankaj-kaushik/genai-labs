# 🧪 genai-labs

**Learn GenAI by building real systems, not just calling APIs.**

`genai-labs` is a hands-on laboratory for experimenting with **Generative AI system design patterns** such as RAG, agents, prompt engineering, and LLM-powered applications.  
This repository contains **small, focused GenAI experiments and proof-of-concept projects** built for learning, exploration, and rapid iteration.

## 🎯 Why this repo exists

Most GenAI tutorials stop at:
- “Call an LLM”
- “Pass a prompt”
- “Get an answer”

This repo goes deeper 👇

- How do GenAI systems **actually work end-to-end**?
- How do we design **scalable, debuggable, and extensible** AI systems?
- What trade-offs exist between different approaches?

Each experiment in this repo focuses on **one core idea**, explained through **working code**.
